    <p class="intro">Hello my name is Julia McCavitt. I never thought I would be intrested in coding but I took a chance and I am proud that I took a leap of faith. I also enjoy film making, softball, and writing. I love problem solving and coding is a great outlite for that. I think it proved to me that you should always try new things because you may find your passion. Please use this page to look at my projects and to contact me about future ones!</p>
